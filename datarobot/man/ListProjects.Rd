\usage{
ListProjects(filter = NULL)

ListProjects(filter = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter}{list. Optional. A named list that can be used to specify various filters.
Currently `projectName` is supported which will filter returned projects for projects with
names containing the specified string.}

\item{...}{Additional keyword arguments to be passed on to the \code{datarobot.apicore} and \code{httr} libraries.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class 'projectSummaryList', consisting of the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item projectId. List of character strings giving the unique DataRobot identifier for each
    project.
  \item projectName. List of character strings giving the user-supplied project names.
  \item fileName. List of character strings giving the name of the modeling dataset for each
    project.
  \item stage. List of character strings specifying each project's Autopilot stage (e.g., 'aim'
    is necessary to set target). Use \code{ProjectStage} to get a list of options.
  \item autopilotMode. List of integers specifying the Autopilot mode (0 = fully automatic,
    1 = semi-automatic, 2 = manual).
  \item created. List of character strings giving the project creation time and date.
  \item target. List of character strings giving the name of the target variable for each
    project.
  \item metric. List of character strings identifying the fitting metric optimized for each
    project.
  \item partition. Dataframe with one row for each project and 12 columns specifying
    partitioning details.
  \item advancedOptions. Dataframe with one row for each project and 4 columns specifying values
    for advanced option parameters.
  \item positiveClass. Character string identifying the positive target class for binary
    classification projects.
  \item maxTrainPct. The maximum percentage of the project dataset that can be used without going
    into the validation data or being too large to submit any blueprint for training a project.
  \item maxTrainRows. The maximum number of rows that can be trained on without going into the
    validation data or being too large to submit any blueprint for training.
  \item scaleoutMaxTrainPct. The maximum percentage of the project dataset that can be used to
    successfully train a scaleout model without going into the validation data. May exceed
    \code{maxTrainPct}, in which case only scaleout models can be trained up to this point.
  \item scaleoutMaxTrainRows. The maximum number of rows that can be used to successfully
    train a scaleout model without going into the validation data. May exceed
    \code{maxTrainRows}, in which case only scaleout models can be trained up to this point.
  \item holdoutUnlocked. Logical flag indicating whether holdout subset results have been
    computed.
  \item targetType. Character string giving the type of modeling project (e.g., regression or
    binary classification).

\description{
List projects

This function returns an S3 object of class projectSummaryList
that describes all (optionally filtered) DataRobot modeling projects available to the user.
This list may be converted into a dataframe with the as.data.frame
method for this class of S3 objects.
}
\details{
List all available projects.

This method invokes \verb{GET /projects/} in the DataRobot Public API.

\title{Train a new frozen model with parameters from specified model}
\usage{
RequestFrozenModel(model, samplePct = NULL, trainingRowCount = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An S3 object of class dataRobotModel like that returned by
the function GetModel, or each element of the list returned by
the function ListModels.}

\item{samplePct}{Numeric, specifying the percentage of the training
dataset to be used in building the new model}

\item{trainingRowCount}{integer. The number of rows to use to train
the requested model.}
}
\value{
An integer value that can be used as the modelJobId parameter
in subsequent calls to the GetModelFromJobId function.

\description{
Frozen models use the same tuning parameters as their parent model
instead of independently optimizing them to allow efficiently
retraining models on larger amounts of the training data.
}
\details{
Either `sample_pct` or `training_row_count` can be used to specify the amount of data to
use, but not both. If neither are specified, a default of the maximum amount of data that
can safely be used to train any blueprint without going into the validation data will be
selected.
In smart-sampled projects, `samplePct` and `trainingRowCount` are assumed to be in terms of rows
of the minority class.

Note : For datetime partitioned projects, use `RequestFrozenDatetimeModel` instead

\details{
Retrieve the specified feature with descriptive information. Descriptive information for features also includes summary statistics as of v2.8. These are returned via the fields max, min, mean, median, and stdDev. These fields are formatted according to the original feature type of the feature. For example, the format will be numeric if your feature is numeric, in feet and inches if your feature is length type, in currency if your feature is currency type, in time format if your feature is time type, or in ISO date format if your feature is a date type. Numbers will be rounded so that they have at most two non-zero decimal digits. For projects created prior to v2.8, these descriptive statistics will not be available. Also, some features, like categorical and text features, may not have summary statistics.

This method invokes \verb{GET /projects/\{projectId\}/features/\{featureName\}/} in the DataRobot Public API.

For each file supplied as form data, you must have a corresponding `filePath` supplied that shows the relative location of the file. For example, you have two files: `/home/username/custom-task/main.py` and `/home/username/custom-task/helpers/helper.py`. When uploading these files, you would _also_ need to include two `filePath` fields of, `\\\"main.py\\\"` and `\\\"helpers/helper.py\\\"`. If the supplied `file` already exists at the supplied `filePath`, the old file is replaced by the new file. (optional)

  # Create a custom task
  #  Creates a new custom task and returns the newly created metadata record for it.  A custom task may either be an estimator or a transform. Estimators must support a single target type (e.g. binaryClassification, regression). Regression and anomaly detection models are expected to produce predictions that are arbitrary floating-point or integer numbers. A classification model is expected to return predictions with probability scores for each class.  For example, a binary classification model might return:  .. code:: Python      {         positiveClassLabel: probability,         negativeClassLabel: 1.0 - probability     }  Transforms are expected to return a dataframe or sparse matrix with the same number of rows as the input feature matrix. At this time, only numeric outputs are supported for custom transforms.

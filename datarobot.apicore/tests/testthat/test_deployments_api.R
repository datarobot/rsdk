  # Retrieve Scoring Code
  # Retrieve Scoring Code of the current deployed model for making predictions outside of a DataRobot prediction server. You need the \&quot;Scoring Code\&quot; feature enabled to use this route.  By default, returns a compiled executable JAR that can be executed locally to calculate model predictions, or it can be used as a library for a Java application. Execute it with the &#39;--help&#x60; parameters to learn how to use it as a command-line utility. See model API documentation at https://javadoc.io/doc/com.datarobot/datarobot-prediction/latest/index.html to be able to use it inside an existing Java application.  With sourceCode query parameter set to &#39;true&#39;, returns a source code archive that can be used to review internal calculations of the model. This JAR is NOT executable.  See \&quot;https://app.datarobot.com/docs/predictions/scoring-code/scorecode.html\&quot; documentation in DataRobot application for more information.  *Note* Cannot retrieve source code if agent is included.

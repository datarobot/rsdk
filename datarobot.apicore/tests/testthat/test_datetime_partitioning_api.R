  # Preview the fully specified datetime partitioning generated by the requested configuration.  Populates the full datetime partitioning that would be used if the same arguments were passed to :http:patch:&#x60;/api/v2/projects/(projectId)/aim/&#x60; based on the requested configuration, generating defaults for all non-specified values, so that potential configurations can be tested prior to setting the target and applying a configuration.  &#x60;useTimeSeries&#x60; controls whether a time series project should be created or a normal project that uses datetime partitioning. See :ref:&#x60;Time-Series Projects&lt;time_series_overview&gt;&#x60; for more detail on the differences between time series projects and datetime partitioned projects. Time-series projects are only available to some users and use the additional settings of &#x60;featureDerivationWindowStart&#x60; and &#x60;featureDerivationWindowEnd&#x60; to establish feature derivation window and &#x60;forecastWindowStart&#x60; and &#x60;forecastWindowEnd&#x60; to establish a forecast window. The overview referenced above provides more information about using feature derivation and forecast windows.  When specifying a feature derivation window of a forecast window, the number of units it spans (end - start) must be an integer multiple of the timeStep of the datetimePartitionColumn.  All durations and datetimes should be specified in accordance with the :ref:&#x60;timestamp and duration formatting rules&lt;time_format&gt;&#x60;.

  # Retrieve datetime partitioning configuration  The datetime partition object in the response describes the full partitioning parameters. Since it becomes available after the target has been fully specified and the project is ready for modeling, there are some additional fields available compared to the response from :http:post:&#x60;/api/v2/projects/(projectId)/datetimePartitioning/&#x60;.  The available training data corresponds to all the data available for training, while the primary training data corresponds to the data that can be used to train while ensuring that all backtests are available.

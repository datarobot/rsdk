  # @param offset integer Specifies the number of results to skip for pagination.
  # @param limit integer Sets the maximum number of results returned. Enter 0 to specify no limit.
  # @param initialCacheSize integer The initial cache size, for Mongo search only.
  # @param useCache character Sets whether to use the cache, for Mongo search only. (optional)
  # @param orderBy character The attribute sort order applied to the returned catalog list: 'catalogName', 'originalName', 'description', 'created', or 'relevance'. For all options other than 'relevance', prefix the attribute name with a dash to sort in descending order. e.g., orderBy='-catalogName'. Defaults to '-created'. (optional)
